"Ordered red hot fried and hot honey fried. The taste is good for a fried chicken. The sauce is not coated evenly., but that's okay I guess. The size is big, that's good.",1,en-AU,0,BASELINE-ROBERTALARG
"I wish we had found this place for lunch, but instead, we tried one of the other places but stopped here for Bingsu. From what we did see, the food looks like a winner here, so I will be back to try on the next trip. Serving was decent and a great concept for a restaurant with various Asian Cuisine options.",1,en-AU,0,BASELINE-ROBERTALARG
"If you're in the mood for a culinary adventure, look no further than Starfish. Nestled alongside a picturesque riverside patio, this gem of a bistro offers an exquisite selection of seafood and wood-fired pizza that will leave your taste buds dancing with delight. The standout for me was the delectable Thai Chicken Pizza. The harmonious blend of zesty Thai flavors with succulent chicken and perfectly baked crust was nothing short of a taste revelation. It's a bold fusion that pays off in spades-a must-try for any pizza enthusiast. Equally impressive were the Curly Fries. Golden and crispy on the outside, with just the right amount of seasoning, they were a delightful accompaniment to our meal. These fries elevated the experience, adding an extra layer of satisfaction.",1,en-AU,0,BASELINE-ROBERTALARG
"Centrum is a very good hotel and located right in place. Mathura bus stand is just a neighbour and the train station is also not too far. Rooms are big enough to accommodate committed people but house keeping service can be one of the best in cost range, they have their own parking for the guests but do n't have dorm for drivers, so you need to arrange a stay for your driver. They have a very good and known food stall, where you can enjoy a yummy veg meal, sweats etc. You can get room service from their restaurant. There are multiple other hotels also if you want to eat somewhere outside.",1,en-IN,0,BASELINE-ROBERTALARG

"Clean and tidy, nice interior. Drinks can be pricey but not much more than anywhere else. Plenty of big screen tv around for watching live sport. Had food here a few times and always been satisfied. One of the better pubs in Scarborough.",1,en-UK,0,BASELINE-ROBERTALARG
"Food was great and I recommend as it matched my pakistani taste buds  but following observations. 1. No menu card( I do n't know why) 2. Ordered lamb Haneed, One portion with rice, but if one person is eating they charge 15, if two persons are eating they charge 19 for the same quantity of food, reason, I do n't know. 3. I did n't get the free banana, other tables where Africans were eating, they gave banana, not to us. Sad. 4. I was with family, so sat in family area which was alright  but it was noisy in the restaurant. 5. Chili sauce, was very very very hot, did n't like it  but lemon soup was fantastic and soooper yummy. 6. Staff was n't understanding english much  it was tough to communicate.. but they were friendly. 7. I will still recommend for the taste.",1,en-UK,0,BASELINE-ROBERTALARG
