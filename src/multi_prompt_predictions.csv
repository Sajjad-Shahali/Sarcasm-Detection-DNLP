Tapas had the best corn fritters I can remember, tasty salmon on fried wontons, meat balls with cumin( yum), and some sticky pork belly.

"I really wanted to give this place higher rating, but unfortunately could n't find a good enough reason to. Starting with the positive, prices are super competitive, most dishes are under 16. However, moving to the negative, dishes are on the small side, my kids and wife( not big eaters) asked to stop at a bakery after our meal as they were hungry. We also felt quality of food could have been much better. A few examples:-The cinnamon toast was flooded with butter, we could n't finish it.-Poached eggs on the Benedict were over cooked( like hard boiled egg)-Dishes were all super basic in execution, an average home cook could have easily done a better job.

Tried this place because it came recommended by my parents. I enjoyed the Chicken 65 buriyani. The Chicken 65 was soo tasty. Everything was tasty it sure cleared my sinuses with the right amount of spices. I really liked the appetiser of the Puri filled tamarind chutney and yogurt. Soo good. Enjoyed saag paneer and did n't really have time goat curry as the buriyani was enough. I got that for my aunt. Loved the roti and naans even if a bit over priced. The food is definitely tasty and nice. However a bit pricey. I always think Indian food is pricey. But I could have ordered only 1 buriyani. I downloaded the app to get reward points and 5 off.

Which is ridiculous cos line for more than one pack gets stagnant while one pack line moves since they serve only that line. They need to adopt a number serving system soon I think.

Surreal is an excellent restaurant and the food is superb and service is efficient however on my third visit in Autumn the room was very cold to the point of having to leave a scarf and jacket on.

The next morning the Manager( who was quick to respond to our request) came up to our room to inspect and kicked the unit to get it working again. At least it worked. Not only was the hotel in bad shape, but the city too. There is a TAB just downstairs from the accommodation which attracts the wrong types of people. My son( age 7) dodged a bicycle being thrown in his direction from one of the TAB patrons who was yelling and swearing at another patron, they were about to get into a physical altercation.

"It takes 1.6 units of electrical energy to produce 1 unit of hydrogen energy. That's simple chemistry and it can't be changed anymore than you can change the fact that if you set fire to wood you will get hear and light. But then you have to spend more energy refrigerating the hydrogen, and it's so cold it embrittles the pipes etc which have to be frequently replaced, it leaks and so on.
In the Space Shuttle programme, only 55% of the liquid hydrogen was actually burned in the rocket engines - the rest was lost in transit, evapourated in storage and so on. 12.6% was lost simply transferring it from a tanker truck to a storage tank.
So then you are in effect spending 1.6 x 1/0.55 = 2.91 units of energy to get 1 unit of useful hydrogen. Of course, we might suppose that we are going to be more efficient and effective than an agency which has half a century of experience handling liquid hydrogen and has spent billions of dollars trying to make it more efficient and effective, but this seems unlikely.
This only works if we have some massive surplus of renewable electricity which we have no other use for, so that we don't care that most of it is wasted in the process. Given that fossil fuels are still being used for about 2/3rds of the country's electricity, this seems unlikely to happen in the near future.

">The way people in her focus groups see it, she says, ""it doesn't matter whether interest rates are up or interest rates are down, or unemployment is up or unemployment is down, doesn't matter if it's a pandemic, not a pandemic, GFC or not a GFC, housing is a horror show"".
The irony of someone associated saying this without some degree of analytical backup is hilarious; folks looking for their first home would probably agree, those renting/looking for the next one would also agree (aka the demographic that has been ignored for the last few decades), those who just bought a home and getting hit with the reality of ""sometimes rates go up"" would agree, however those either fully paid off mortgage wise, or majority paid off I struggle to believe have the same sentiment as they would be pushing for their investment to drop in value.

">The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the reform would protect any Victorian who made a report to police, granting them complete immunity if their alleged perpetrator tries to bring a defamation suit against them.
Allegations usually result in the person alleged having their freedom compromised very quickly through being detained or bailed, regardless if they are actually innocent. As we have seen in other recent developments of making bail harder to obtain, the net result of allegation is effectively punishing a person in advance of determining their guilt by using the justice system process against them.
Once in the justice system, mud sticks even if the alleged criminal is proven not guilty. Until recently, innocent people could better protect themself against the effects of false allegation by taking defamation action, but this new legislation appears to block that avenue, meaning the justice system would now effectively be protecting people making false allegations.
I acknowledge the issue of people being fearful of coming forward to report crimes, however a balance needs to be struck here against the ability to punish people through mere allegation, which may also be false, in advance of a judgement of guilt.
The proposed legislation appears to effectively grant accusers immunity from false allegations.
In our system of justice, the costs of making allegations is borne by the state, however the cost of defense, including defending their reputation, against allegations is usually borne by the defendant. Part of this defense is the ability to raise defamation action against false accusation. Without that option, the defendant is subject to public slander and loss of freedom as punishments in advance of even proof of guilt, based merely on allegation. Even if proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt fails, the defendant is not compensated for the loss of public standing and the punishment already meted out by the justice system in advance of the verdict.
Whilst I understand the court has some leeway to punish an accuser for false allegations, this is not prescribed.
Justice is supposed to be for both accused and accuser, but we are increasingly seeing justice be applied in favour of the accuser, allowing false or unfounded accusations to punish the accused, regardless of the outcome of the court.
Crimes need to be objective harms of import, because our system of justice already punishes people based on allegation only, regardless of their guilt, which stretches the integrity of justice and the presumption of innocence. To also punish people, regardless of their guilt, as revenge for subjective hurt feelings would be outrageous, however many crimes are just that, based on subjective hurt feelings and not objective harms.
I urge the justice system not to keep lowering the threshold to criminal activity, so that false accusations can more easily be used to punish innocent people regardless of the court judgement.
I think society has lost focus of the principle of justice to more easily allow the revenge punishment of innocent people for subjective hurt feelings and for advantage. We have to find a better method of progressing justice that honours both the accused and accuser equally along with the presumption of innocence.
If a crime is of sufficient import and true, then it is worthwhile pursuing and if that is still having a chilling effect on coming forward, then we need to address why that is, not develop knee-jerk legislation to make it easier to punish people through using the justice system itself on unfounded or false allegation as revenge for subjective feelings.
>This perception that victim-survivors will be sued for speaking up can sometimes become a reality when they are threatened with defamation suits.
If an allegation is truthful, why would a defamation action succeed? Making a threat is pointless and has no power if it can't be carried out: that is where reason comes into the equation instead of capitulating to fear and paranoia.
However, I recognise that defamation law has severe limitations and I believe it needs to be re-evaluated along with the judicial process to return to the fundamental principles of justice.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sarcasm,0.53406334,0.4659367,0,0.9782964,0.021703552,0,0.99945337,0.0005465754,0,0.9991072,0.0008927921,0,0,0.8777300715444278,0.12226990262567268

"Hypothetical situation:

"The massive corpo I work for have rolled out WTC before each meeting because Lloyd's of London in the UK said they wouldn't provide us with reinsurance unless we improved our ESG score. 
As an insurance company which neither owns any infrastructure or manufactures anything physical, the E (environmental) bit is difficult to do anything about or improve. As for the G (governance), the executive team aren't willing to invest the time and expense of restructuring and we are already very highly regulated. Therefore that only leave S (social). 
It's been inexpensive to throw up a few rainbow flags around the office and implement WTC. It's shallow and meaningless imo but keeps our reinsurance premiums down.

Trillions was spent for the GFC and to stop a total collapse of the system. That money needed to be paid back, and the quickest and easiest way was to rapidly increase the tax base via immigration. 
Same with Covid, it's literally by design. Problem is, it takes decades to build up the infrastructure, training, teachers and support etc to accommodate such levels of immigration.

"Ex-chef here I very rarely tip these days as I don't go out anywhere near as much as I did and it's only in exceptional circumstances that I will. 
It doesn't matter what type of place it is, either. 
It could be a shitty little el cheapo breakfast place that serves bacon, eggs, and grilled tomato with supermarket white toast, that has been halved into triangles to fill the Kmart plates it's served on and the server, waiter or whatever is the perfect example of what hospitality service should be I've been known to leave a $20 under the dirty plate and leaving before they clear the table, being sure to say thanks to them for breakfast on my way out. Make me feel like I'm a part of your local community, or an old friend not just a customer.
I've worked in kitchens at some reasonably top shelf places, and have never recieved any cut of the tips. Depending on the clientele, it wasn't unusual for $2k in tips to be left. Which would only ever go straight into the waiter's pocket. Apparently, only the service was good and the food must have been shit I don't tip in those places. I'm already paying out the arse for the meals and drinks, and I'm not overly fond of  adding to what is probably already a decent pot for the evening.

"The Australian Federal Police union is threatening strike action to ""shut down"" airports and the sitting of federal parliament in a severe escalation of its dispute with the Albanese government over pay and conditions.  
AFP Association president Alex Caruana said the union had sought legal advice about whether AFP officers could legally walk out at airports and when parliament was sitting, saying members were sick of being ""disrespected"" by government. ""(We are considering) walking out at airports, walking out at Parliament House, walking out from other commonwealth assets and essentially shutting them down in order to make a point to the government and the AFP that we are serious about fighting for our pay and conditions and we want a fair pay deal,"" he told The Australian.  
Denouncing the government's latest pay offer of 11.2 per cent, Mr Caruana said he had spoken to about 1000 AFPA members in recent days and ""it's very clear they are very willing to vote yes to that action"".  
""Essentially, it would be that airports might have to shut down, parliament would have to stop sitting and certain other assets might have to come up with other arrangements,"" he said, identifying the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and the Holsworthy Barracks as other potential locations for industrial action. ""It is a severe escalation but our members are sick of being disrespected by the government and by the AFP, and they want a fair pay deal. They don't want to be the lowest paid police force in Australia.""  
The AFPA is urging members to vote no to the AFP pay offer, which includes increases to allowances on top of 11.2 per cent in wage rises over three years.
If the offer is rejected, Mr Caruana said the union would examine applying to the Fair Work Commission for a protected action ballot order to authorise more significant industrial action. ""It's difficult for the AFP to do any strike action, or withholding of labour action, because of the implications to national security,"" he said. ""What I can say is that we are engaging some lawyers to look at what our options are in that space. ""We would consider that if we were to withdraw some labour from the airports, and we were to withdraw labour from places like Parliament House, from places like ANTSO and a few other places like Holsworthy etc, we're not actually putting the community at risk. ""If the airports continue to operate, the airports are then taking on that risk. If parliament chooses to sit, the parliament is then taking that risk but we are currently getting legal advice as to whether or not under the AFP Act, that would be in breach of national security and a step too far. We will consider any measures necessary to get the point across to government and the AFP that they need to offer a fair wage deal for AFP members.""",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sarcasm,0.008172616,0.99182737,1,0.13111112,0.8688889,1,0.9927498,0.0072501195,0,0.17950375,0.8204962,1,1,0.3278843238948956,0.6721156510755603

"I've got friends from the US,  Canada and France that also commented on how prevalent it was here. 
I'm 40 and have never had a full time job. ( Well technically I have but it was month to month contracts and anyone who took a day off for any reason didn't have their contacts renewed.) 
I've been in my current job for 8 years and got denied permanency based on the fact that my shifts are irregular, and the annoying thing is the union rep agreed. Like I worked 2583 hours last financial year but because it wasn't 8 hrs a day 6 days a week, every week I don't get permanent.
Also as someone whose been casual for a while, other things have changed, like how long before a shift begins that they are scheduling something , places are literally getting calls from clients and saying yeah we can do that today for you, then ringing around staff to see whose available. It's shifting the risk/cost of business from the employer to the employee.
The law hasn't caught up with technology, I've talked to people who did my job more than 30 years ago, casual wasn't a thing because most people didn't have mobile phones, so they paid people to be on call, they don't anymore because everyone has a mobile so if I don't answer they'll try someone else and eventually someone will pickup and agree to come in. I've brought that up with the union and again they don't care.
 I want at a minimum what a friend in the US told me that they were proposing in his state ( can't remember if it went through) they were proposing a minimum notice period for temps ( what they call casuals) of 72hrs.

"This is an old post I've shamelessly copied and pasted that explains why this belief is bullshit 
Australian ecologist here: my god, there is a lot of rubbish being touted in this thread.
Okay, first up: there are not more dangerous animals in Australia then elsewhere. This is a misconception fueled by silliness and exoticism. The famous list of Australia having nearly all of the world's most venomous snakes comes from a terrible LD50 study that only used five or so overseas snakes for comparison. To get a more accurate impression of relative venom toxicity, check out Dr Bryan Greig Fry's LD50 page.
For the question of why we have so many venomous snakes here to begin with, one has to look at the dispersal of snakes within Australia. First there was the best snakes of all (fact), the Aspidites-- primitive snakes that branched off the snake family before pythons evolved. Australia was pretty empty with just these guys around, so when the elapids came down from Asia, there was lots of space for them to diversify into. Elapids are very venomous snakes with fixed front fangs: cobras, mamba, etc. All venomous snakes in Australia are descended from these elapids.
Australia has pretty venomous snakes because they all came from highly venomous stock. Since elapids were the main game in town for so long, they diversified to take over all niches, from super-venomous (which get a lot of attention) to nearly lacking venom all together (which no-one pays much attention to!). So Australia has a diverse range of venomous snakes, not just highly venomous ones. Focusing on the big hitters and making ridiculous guesses as to why they're here is missing the bigger picture.
The very venomous sea snakes that we have are simply land elapids that diversified into the oceans.
Our spiders are not more venomous that those of anywhere else in the world. We haven't had a spider-bite fatality since the'50s, and even then it was children and the elderly that succumbed.
South America and Africa have many more venomous species than Australia, including more venomous lizards and venomous mammals (!).

Best cafe in kottayam situated opposite to Ceaser Palace. Got ample car parking. Opens upto 12 am. Staffs are super friendly. I am a reqular customer since their initial time. Found best in town at that time. But today sad to say that the items are not consistent in taste wise. Best dishes # Steak with mashed potato and sauted veggies # tikka with afgani rice # crispy fried burger # crumb fried sausages # penne pasta with meat balls # loaded Fries # Club sandwich # Fried samoosa # hot chocolate( advised not to add extra sugar as it is already sweeetened) # Lemon ice tea # juices # waffles # Ceaser salad # Brownie # coffee # shakes # blood Mary mojitos Juicy Lucy burger is not that ones which we get in abroad. Not recommended. Outdoor seating is there. Advised to sit outside if you are planning for a date or a meeting beacuse the music that they are playing is at high volume and can cause irritation. They got a massive 75 inch television for live matches. Got barista machine. Clean and neat washroom is there. Even if you tell them for rare or medium rare beef steak you will get only welldone UPI and POS is there. Never expect taste consistency.

"I am editing the review after an year, in these have went to the restaurant for 15 to 20 times and ordered through swiggy.

Chicken lollipops are worst. I got leftover food delivered to me which I ordered through swiggy, chicken was hard to chew and dry. Also, have tasted nalli gosh biryani which is awesome in taste. I can see that the quality is decreasing over the time. We have ordered: mutton hot & sour soup( Rs 145), tandoori half plate( Rs 250), mutton dum biryani( Rs 350). 1. Mutton soup was a bit spicy.

"You love everything associated with you right from your early childhood and manhood. Is n't it ? One of such places to me is TIRUCHY CAFE. Not this one. It was opened as a branch of the old but evergreen TIRUCHY CAFE, near MANIKOONDU( Clock Tower) associated with me right from my college days. I studied my PRE UNIVERSITY COURSE( popularly known as PUC) and degree course at CHIKKAIAH NAICKER MAHAJANA COLLEGE at VEERAPPAN CHATRAM, a locality of Erode Corporation. TIRUCHY CAFE FOOD PARADISE A / C is a branch of it. Every, TIRUCH CAFE, irrespective of their names, offer traditional native recipes. It is a vegetarian hotel, serving Tiffin in the morning, meals in the noon, snacks and tiffin during evening and night. The ambience ca n't be termed as grandeur but the recipes are mouth watering. Especially the MOREKUZHAMBU( a side dish watery in nature and yellow in color, prepared with curd) they provide for meals is excellent in taste. They undertake outdoor catering orders too. A parking lot for 4 wheelers and 2 wheelers is at the back of the hotel. An advertisement regarding car parking is appended herein. There, a advice that the parking lot is free for the first 20 minutes and thereafter it is chargeable, is exhibited. Hot and cold beverages are available, throughout. Rest rooms are there. Not wheelchair accessible. I RECOMMEND THE RESTAURANT FOR A SATISFYING TIFFIN OR MEAL. IT IS NOT EXPENSIVE. THE RESTAURANT IS ON METTUR ROAD NEAR ERODE BUS STAND just opposite to KALYAN LODGE.

The big screen, state-of-the-art sound system, and comfortable seating create a cinematic experience that is hard to replicate at home. The darkness of the theatre and the lack of distractions help to draw you into the world of the film, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in the story.

"My father was a government employee. He hated polling duties. Only very high ranking officials get good facilities. Although he was generally exempt from polling duties due to his job profile. 
One time, when he was a high ranking official, he was attached as zonal coordinator for Election Observer. He was provided an AC Cab, an armed Escort and contact info for all District election officers ( DM) in the region. He left home two days before the election with the Observer, travelling through remote polling booths making sure fair elections are being held. Calling police forces were needed, diffusing tense situations and returned home in the evening after the elections were done. 
He was accommodated in good hotels and guest houses, circuit houses, private guest houses of industries though he had hardly any time to eat or sleep. On the election eve, he got a call from a presiding officer of a booth about a broken machine. He went to the room of the DM of the district who was staying in the same guest house. DM opened the door, while talking on the phone on his shoulder while feeding the baby with a bottle. 
Some people will be like, so what if government employees have to work hard for a few days, most people work hard everyday. That's true, the only difference is that in case of election duty, every mistake is a fireable offense with jail time. And it's so easy to make mistakes when you have no idea what you are doing.  
You forgot to paint the finger for a voter? Jailed.
You were late for reporting to duty? Jailed.
You couldn't come to duty as you were hospitalized? Yeah Jailed.

"I rather liked the Benjamin Huntsman when I visited on a recent trip to Sheffield. Located at the top of Cambridge St, it is only round the corner from another Wetherspoons, the Wather Works. Benjamin Huntsman was notable for this steel producing town as he invented crucible or cast steel & he opened a plant in Sheffield around 1740.

"mainly due to the "" loaded fries "" I say that loosely. The main reason for Nandoes was to try the loaded fries, and was just mega disappointed. But I'll get to that at the end. Sunset Burger: Absolutely lovely, and tasty. Around on its own I believe, and then instead of going for the sides we opted for the loaded fries as another dish instead. The burger as a stand alone item would be. Loaded fries: Do n't get fooled by advertisement. It was 8, and I tasted 5 too much. Firstly the loaded element, which was hard to find any chicken it claimed to have in, I think I counted around 3 strands. And then alot of the loaded, is very central, so you feel there is no flavour else where. The main issue is the flavour / taste, the only way to describe it, is it tasted like the old mini oven pizzas I used to have when I was younger. The taste was identical to that pizza, which was so odd to have that cheap oven pizza taste on chips. It did n't have any unique flavours, or any spice. We had to drown it in hot sauce, to then get Hot Oven Pizza flavour. Honestly I would n't recommend it at all, it's not worth disappointing yourself for 8.

"Went on a whim and ordered here despite my previous abysmal experience with Pizza Hut in Hayes. I was pleasantly surprised. The first thing I noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked. The crust golden, like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque Caribbean beach. Perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect. Secondly, the cheese was there. Usually I am second guessing myself, wondering if I had accidentally clicked the' Extra Dough' option when ordering, rather than extra cheese. This time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency-something that I wo n't deduct points for. Anyway, having a few slices with a bit less cheese, knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal. The sauce was plenty ladled, and because the pizza was n't overcooked, the toppings were juicy and tender. Remember, if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop.

Etles spicy trotters: the sauce on this is truly exceptional, I personally love the texture of trotters so I really enjoyed this dish, maybe something for the more adventurous eaters as my friend did n't like the texture( but still loved the sauce).

"The last Gov report showed the cost to the UK of reoffending was around 18 billion a year. 
The same statistics put the cost of housing a prisoner each year somewhere around 50k.
In the UK currently we have 95k people in prison.
Let's say we invest 10 of that lost 18 billion into increased prison capacity. That would house an additional 200k people. We could literally triple our prison population and still be saving money. This whole economic benefit of releasing people is a myth.
People have this fairy tinted view that everyone can be reformed, they can't. It's not uncommon for prolific offenders to have anywhere from 100-300 convictions. Releasing them does nothing but bring more misery into their local communities because it is a certainty they will reoffend.
The whole myth around increased punishment isn't a deterrent argument falls apart as well when scrutinised.

"There are 2 doctors in my surgery to cover over 8000 people and I feel that this understaffing played a part in my mum's death.   
My mum wasn't a well woman, she had MS and was bed bound, had carers coming in to see her 4 times a day and after my dad passed in November the rest of the time it was just me to take care of her and I failed her. For the last few months of her life she had constant UTI's and was in a constant state of confusion with them. No doctor came out to see her despite my having to phone the practice every other week and a couple of times an advanced nurse practitioner came out. One morning I had to phone 999 as I couldn't get her to wake and ended up having to perform chest compressions on her. Long story short I had to leave her after a few hours as my sister was taken into hospital that same day and almost passed that night due to sepsis. I thought I was leaving her in good hands and I needed to help my brother in law with my nephews. Anyhoo 6 hours after being taken she was discharged. A subsequent conversation with the advanced nurse practitioner as my mum was found eating tissue paper I mentioned she had just been in hospital and this practitioner said she wouldn't have been discharged if there was anything wrong and asked me if I wanted her in hospital. I said I just wanted what was best for my mum. She gave my mum a once over and said she could only treat what was in front of her despite me saying that my mum wasn't one to be snacking on fucking tissue paper.
